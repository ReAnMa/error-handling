# get-me-to-work

- The user should see an overview of books
- The user can create a new book with a title and add it to the overview

### What should be done?

- clone the repo to your local machine
- run `npm install` on the global project
- run the code and check the result...

### Oh no...the code is broken!

- Now it is your turn to fix the errors from the console or that happen when using the app
- If you like you can create your own repo in your github account with the solution
- It makes sense to write down some ideas on how you managed to catch the errors

### Tech-Stack

- ```node.js``` server side programming with javascript
- ```express``` framework with build in methods to write faster node.js apps
- ```pug``` one of the many packages that compiles html code for server side templates
